# SOLID Principles

This repository demonstrates the application of the SOLID principles in TypeScript.

It includes:

- Bad design code violating SOLID principles.
- Good design code following SOLID principles.
- TypeScript implementations showing the difference between bad and good design.

Applying SOLID principles helps reduce the reasons for change, improves modularity, enhances maintainability, and leads to cleaner, better-structured code.
